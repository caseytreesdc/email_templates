Join Casey Trees staff at an easy-paced tree
identification walk. We will use Casey Trees Species
Guides to learn key characteristics of tree species to
tell them apart. We will also discuss the benefits that
these trees provide to our urban forest.

 All in all, it was an eventful and successful advocacy
 effort. We would like to thank all CTAs who
 participated in this year&rsquo;s performance
 oversight hearings. Because of our advocacy during the
 performance oversight hearing, we are now talking with
 the D.C. Council to amend the Urban Forest
 Preservation Act and DOEE to update the Green Area
 Ratio.
